Feature Suggestion for a "Taxonomic Name Refresher":
For portal manager updating the taxonomy, it would be helpful to add a tool to update the taxonomic thesaurus in batch across all collections without modifying any occurrence records.
Currently this is only possible by running the taxonomic name cleaner against a repository like fdex, WoRMS, EOL etc. for individual collections, but not using the re-mapping tool.
A "Taxonomic Name Refresher" could be used to add missing names by scanning all collections for names that are not currently included in the thesaurus against names that are available in a particular repository.
This would work by scanning all collections in a portal, but without the remapping feature of the Taxonomic Name Cleaner. It would require Superadmin (or atlernatively Taxon Editor) rights.
Ideally, portal manager could use it as an option to be able to add new names in batch rather than manually. 
Ideally the names would not necessarily be added automatically, but a semi-automatic mode would give the portal manager the choice of names to be added (or perhaps use a filter; in the lichen portal this would be useful to screen out names of non-lichenized fungi).
